Welcome to the project! 

You've just cloned a well-organized web development project that uses Sass for styling. Here's a quick rundown to help you get started:

1. Project Purpose: This appears to be a multi-page website with sections for home, about, contact, and work. The project uses Sass to manage styles efficiently.

2. Key Components:
   - HTML files in the 'dist' folder for different pages
   - Sass files in the 'scss' folder for styling
   - A package.json file to manage dependencies and scripts

3. Getting Started:
   - Run `npm install` to set up the project dependencies (mainly Sass).
   - Use the `npm run compile:sass` command to watch and compile Sass files.

4. Project Structure:
   - 'dist': Contains the HTML files for the website pages
   - 'scss': Houses the Sass files for styling
   - 'node_modules': Stores project dependencies

5. Contribution Tips:
   - Edit HTML files in the 'dist' folder to modify page content
   - Update styles by working with the Sass files in the 'scss' folder
   - Use the provided Sass compilation script to see your style changes

That's it! You're now ready to start contributing. Happy coding!

Topic: Effects

Based on your current SCSS file, you have already implemented several interesting text effects using CSS animations. To provide you with more unique and engaging effects that are not related to text, I have compiled a list of ideas that you can incorporate into your portfolio website.

1. **Parallax Backgrounds**: Create a parallax scrolling effect for your website's background images. This can be achieved by applying a CSS transform and perspective property to the background elements. You can also use JavaScript to control the speed of the parallax effect based on user scrolling.

2. **Interactive Buttons**: Add interactive animations to your buttons, such as changing colors, scaling, or rotating when hovered over or clicked. You can use CSS transitions or animations to create these effects.

3. **Animated Navigation**: Implement a smooth animated navigation menu that slides in or fades in when the user hovers over it. You can use CSS transitions or animations to create the desired effect.

4. **Loading Spinners**: Create a custom loading spinner animation using CSS animations. This can be used to indicate that content is loading or processing. You can use SVGs or CSS to create the spinner.

5. **Interactive Forms**: Add interactive animations to your form elements, such as shaking or wiggling when an error occurs or when the user successfully submits the form. You can use CSS transitions or animations to create these effects.

6. **Interactive Cards**: Create interactive card elements that flip or rotate when hovered over. You can use CSS transitions or animations to create the desired effect.

7. **Interactive Accordions**: Implement an interactive accordion menu that expands and collapses when clicked. You can use CSS transitions or animations to create the desired effect.

8. **Interactive Progress Bars**: Create interactive progress bars that fill up or shrink based on user actions or progress. You can use CSS transitions or animations to create the desired effect.

9. **Interactive Modals**: Create interactive modals that appear when a user clicks on a button or link. You can use CSS transitions or animations to create the desired effect.

10. **Interactive Carousels**: Implement an interactive carousel or slider that automatically cycles through images or content. You can use CSS transitions or animations to create the desired effect.

11. **Interactive Maps**: Add interactive animations to your maps, such as highlighting regions or showing tooltips when hovered over. You can use CSS transitions or animations to create the desired effect.

12. **Interactive Charts**: Create interactive charts or graphs that respond to user actions, such as highlighting data points or changing the chart type. You can use CSS transitions or animations to create the desired effect.

13. **Interactive Video Player**: Add interactive animations to your video player, such as showing a play button or creating a progress bar. You can use CSS transitions or animations to create the desired effect.

14. **Interactive Audio Player**: Create an interactive audio player that allows users to control playback, such as showing a waveform or creating a progress bar. You can use CSS transitions or animations to create the desired effect.

15. **Interactive Infographics**: Add interactive animations to your infographics, such as highlighting key points or showing tooltips when hovered over. You can use CSS transitions or animations to create the desired effect.

Feel free to explore these ideas and experiment with different techniques to enhance your portfolio website. Remember to keep your code clean, maintainable, and well-documented for future reference.
